#Here is what I did for you: I did compute the mean emissions and emission factors of DEFRA, ADEME and MyClimate (they all account similarly for non-CO2 effects with a multiplication factor of 2). I did compute these for a large range of distances from 100 to 20000 km. This distance is for one single continuous leg of a trip. If a trip is split in two legs (of distances d1 and d2) you must compute the emission for each leg (d1 and d2) and then sum up. The result would be wrong if you were computing emission directly for d=d1+d2 (shorter duration flights are more emitting than longer ones). I would suggest that based on your distances you interpolate within the table I provide in the attachement and you are all set. I also attach some plots and my paper where all this is described (e.g. as you may be considering legs precisely, I have removed the 5% overhead in the distance to account for connecting flights).
